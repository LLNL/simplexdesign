simplexdesign is a small collection of tools for the design of statistical experiments on Agent Based Models.  It includes a coordinate exchange algorithm for homogeneous agents, and more generally any simplex.  There is also an optimization algorithm for the case with multiple classes of homogeneous agents. See our paper "Uncertainty Quantification for Models of Homogeneous Agents" for more details when it is published. 

Getting Started
----------------
simplexdesign can be downloaded and installed inside of RStudio by using the devtools package.  If you do not have the devtools package run:
> install.package("devtools")

once devtools is installed, run:
> library(devtools)
> install_github("kquinlan/simplexdesign")


Documentation
----------------

Documentation is included in the package.  It can be viewed in RStudio with the command: help(simplexdesign)
